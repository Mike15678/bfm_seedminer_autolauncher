What's new in bfm_seedminer_autolauncher v3.0.0:
  * This script is now licensed under the MIT license! :)
  * The whole entire script was refactored to have less bugs and checks are now practically everywhere
to make sure things work as intended.
  * psutil is now a dependency. The script will ask you if you want it to be auto-installed.
  * All extra files now go into a "bfm_misc/" directory and will be
automatically moved if they already exist.
  * Logging was improved and now each event recorded inside of a log file
shows time, log level, and a message.
  * You are now able to quit the script after a job has finished. To do so, press
Ctrl-C during a job or whenever the script has has you wait before your next job is received.
  * Further improvements to overall BruteforceMovable stability and other minor adjustments have been made
to enhance the mining experience.
